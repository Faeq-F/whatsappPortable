# A portable desktop WhatsApp application
The [WebView2 Runtime](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/?form=MA13LH) is required ([preinstalled onto all Windows 11 devices and eligible Windows 10 devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/concepts/distribution?tabs=dotnetcsharp))

## Why?
I use a Gecko-based browser, the kind that WhatsApp Web seems to have a lot of trouble working with. I do not want to use other browsers and do not wish to use an installed desktop app. Other portable applications like [WhatsAppâ„¢ portable from portapps](https://portapps.io/app/whatsapp-portable/) have known [issues](https://github.com/portapps/whatsapp-portable/issues/64), preventing them from being useable.
